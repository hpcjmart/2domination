# 2domination

The computation of the domination-type parameters is a challenging problem in Cartesian product graphs. We present an algorithmic method to compute the 2-domination number of the Cartesian product of a path with small order and any cycle, involving the   matrix product. We establish some theoretical results that provide the algorithms necessary to compute that parameter, and the main challenge to run such algorithms comes from the large size of the matrices used, which makes it necessary to improve the techniques to handle these objects. We analyze the performance of the algorithms on modern multicore CPUs and on GPUs and we show the advantages over the sequential implementation. The use of these platforms allows us to compute the 2-domination number of cylinders such that their paths have at most 12 vertices.
